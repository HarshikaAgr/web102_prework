## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. 
One challenge I faced while building the app was adding the search bar. At first, the search only worked if the user typed the exact name of a game already shown on the website, which was confusing. I fixed this by updating the app to display a message saying “No games found for your search” when there were no matching results.
